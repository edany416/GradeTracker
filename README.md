## GradeTracker
GradeTracker is an application that allows students to track their current course.

GradeTracker is the first significant iOS application I built. My goal for this application was to become familiar with Xcode, Swift
and cover as many iOS developement topics as possible via a single application. 

### Topics Covered
- UITableView and required delegate and data source methods.
- UITextField and related delegate methods.
- Working with a storyboard, interface builder, IBOutlets and IBActions.
- Creating my own protocols and using those protocols for blind communication via delegation.
- Custom UIViews and using UIBezierPath in the views draw() method.
- Data persistance using NSCoding
- Enabling and disabling certain action based on user input (i.e. prevent saving is text fields empty).
- UINavigation controller.
- Passing data between segues.
- Basics of autolayout and working with contraints.
- UIGestureRecognizer


### User Stories
- Users can create a course (CSE101, MATH100...).
- Users can create grading criteria for each course (Homework, Exams...).
- Users can input grades recieved on assignments belonging to each criteria.
- Users can see the current grade they have for each course, grading criteria, and assignments.
- Users can edit already created courses, grading criteria and graded assignments.
